## My Advent of Code Solutions

Advent of Code is an Advent Calendar of programming puzzles, it starts every year on 1st December and ends in 25th, so total 25 days, each day has 2 puzzles, 2nd puzzle is a followup question to the 1st one and will usually be much harder.

This Repo will eventually (hopefully ðŸ™ƒ) contain all years puzzle solutions, possibly in Go and Typescript.
